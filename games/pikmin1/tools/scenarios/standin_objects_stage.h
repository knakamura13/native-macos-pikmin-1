// The second stand-in stage: stages/sandbox_objects.ini (#59, objects gap). The
// first one, stages/sandbox.ini, is a flat floor with a few walls and no
// generators; every existing scenario runs there and its numbers (the
// throw_release calibration K) depend on it staying that way. This stage is for
// scenarios that opt in with PIKMIN_SCENARIO_STAGE=stages/sandbox_objects.ini.
//
// It has a heightfield with a cliff on one side and a default.gen that places,
// from the nectar_assets stand-ins only: a blue Onion beside the cliff, three
// buried sprouts, a one-pellet red pellet and a sleeping Dwarf Bulborb. Nothing
// here is read from the disc.
